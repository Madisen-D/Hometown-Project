This is a webpage I created for the Hometown Project. It is based on Splatsville, which is a fictional town from the Splatoon 3 game by Nintendo. 

This project was created using HTML and CSS. I also used GitHub codespaces and VSCode.

It is currently completed, but I want to update it to be more responsive in the future. Currently waiting on some feedback from my Scrimba peers.


ðŸ’¡ Reflection ðŸ’¡

ðŸŸ  I learned
 * How to use display: flex, justify-content, and align-items
 * How to add hover effects using pseudo selectors
 * More about class, id, div, and span tags, and how they're referenced in the CSS
 * Importing fonts and using text files

ðŸŸ¢ What went well
 * I'm very happy with the colors which I got from the Splatoon 3 pages and extracted using coolors.co 
 * I'm very happy with how the Splatoon 3 fonts came out on the page and was very happy I could find them, here is the link for that: https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/13dstg3/i_extracted_the_fonts_from_splatoon_3_and_you_can/
 * I like the hover effects which added motion and context to the activities section.
 * Overall, I think this was something fun to create. I love the game and finding all the resources and making this was really fun.

ðŸ”´ What went poorly
* The website is completely unresponsive to screen size. Some parts are and some are not. That is my biggest issue. I want it to shrink without distortion and I couldn't figure out what element needed to be changed to do so. The width? a meta tag? I'm not sure, but I was missing something.
* No other major issues, I'm happy with what it was for my first try.
